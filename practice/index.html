			<h3>Advent of MPESA</h3>
			<p>
			In the mid-2000s, I was CEO of Safaricom, Vodafone’s Associate in Kenya, and encouraged a small team of people to focus on building innovative products for our customers.   I asked for developments that no-one else had ever done in Kenya, that would be interesting and add value for our customers.
			</p>
			<p>
			Vodafone became aware of the opportunity to get a grant from the Department for International Development in the UK – which was looking for companies interested in developing services to help the unbanked. So, we set about creating straightforward financial services that people could easily use from a basic feature phone.
			</p>
			<p>
			Originally we worked on the idea of microfinance loans using mobile phones, and trialled a prototype service in Thika, north of Nairobi.  What we found in practice was that people who received the loans were sending the money to other people hundreds of miles away.  In hindsight, we had inadvertently identified one of Kenya’s biggest financial challenges.
			</p>
			<p>
			In Kenya, and other parts of Africa, the breadwinner typically travels to urban areas for work while their family stays behind.  In order to send money to their relatives, people would travel for days to get home or give the money to a bus driver.  These people didn’t have access to financial services, and in rural areas there was little, if any, traditional banking infrastructure.  If people did use banks, the cost took a big chunk out of their wages.
			</p>
			<p>
			So we took a chance, and re-engineered the loans system to focus squarely on transmitting money from one phone to another. We wanted to have a ‘branch’ on every street corner, so we needed to recruit a huge network of agents. Our aim was that customers would visit those agents with cash, then, through a series of SMS messages, convert that money into electronic funds that securely sat on their SIM cards.  Then, via SMS, they could transfer that money to anyone else, who would then visit their local agent and withdraw that cash again.  The transaction needed to take place in seconds and the transaction cost would need to be very low.
			</p>
			<p>
			In March 2007, we launched M-Pesa and the rest is history!
